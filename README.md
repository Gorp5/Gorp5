## Hi! ðŸ‘‹
My name is **Jordan** (Some people call me gorp online) I'm an undergraduate in my senior year, but I'm also a Software Engineer and ML Researcher.

My favorite topics in CS currently include:
Feature Learning (via Autoencoders)
Compute Shaders
Data Analysis

and most of all: âœ¨**Learning New Things**âœ¨

Let's connect! Gorpdev@gmail.com

Always excited to collaborate on interesting projects,
